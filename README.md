# How to Write aLiterature Review

A how to guide for writing a literature review for the digital age. 

This was originally a tutorial given at the Fashion Dept. in the Royal College of Art. Intended to be for non-scientists (those who have never studied science before) to learn how to parse scientific research quickly and easily. The key goals are 1) getting an overview of an area of interest, 2) being able to find literature/publications 3) being able to quickly read papers without getting bogged down and 4) being able to reference papers and summarise what you have learned in a written document. **NOTE** this tutorial will be badly referenced, apologies :) 

## 1. Getting an Overview of a Research Area

Do not get intimidated by scientific jargon. Getting a feel for a research area can be as simple as typing the keyword into google (this will be a recurring theme in this tutorial) and looking on twitter. You will get a sense of what is happening and feel some excitment when you see magazine articles or newspaper stories on the topic as well as real scientists talking about their work on platforms like twitter. For instance, type biodesign into google and twitter and enjoy!

## 2. Finding Literature and Scientific Publications

### Finding the Papers

This is so much easier than it used to be. After you have an idea of the field (Biodesign, say) you might find you are very attracted to work done using bacterial cellulose. Creatives and scientists alike are very actively using this material for everything from wound healing to garment design. If you **google** _bacterial cellulose_ you might start seeing scinetific papers (also called articles or _publications_). You can also search only science papers using [**google scholar**](https://scholar.google.com). Here you will see papers listed in the order of most recent or most _cited_ (this means how many times other people have **referenced** that paper in their paper, more on that [later]()). Often really important papers have been published in _journals_ (kind of dedicated science paper magazines) like **Science** or **Nature**, you should make sure to add these to your reading list but lots of very interesting papers are found all over the place. 

### Organising the papers

After a little while you will become overwhelmed with all these papers. It is normal to feel this way. This is when I recommend you download [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com). Create a free account and install the chrome plugin. Read a bit of their introduction and then start creating a few folders to organise your papers. Maybe you are reading about "_bacterial cellulose_" and "_mycellium_" and want to keep them separated. Using the browser plugin makes your life very easy. Click it and it will add the paper to whatever list you have chosen **and** if there is a free version it will download it right away. Browse through the internet like this and add as many papers to your folder as you like. You will begin facing some issues quite quickly though... Paywalls... 

### Getting the Papers for free

After clicking on a few papers you will notice something. They want you to pay about Â£20 for everypaper download. You will not be doing that. You will use a few simple techniques (and the law) to help you! First you will install another browser plugin: the [open access button](https://openaccessbutton.org). Type the paper name, or DOI or just the url link and poof! If a free version exists it will be right there ready to download. Now, if that doesn't work. ..

You can also use dedicated platforms like [researchgate](https://researchgate.net) to search for publications. In general you can be lazy and **just google search** the title, or a few sentances from the _abstract_ and you will probably see a research gate link and the pdf will be free to download. If that doesn't work. Then google the title along with [**BioarXiv**](https://www.biorxiv.org) and hopefully there will be a free version hosted there. If that doesn't work, look at the last author on the list of names and the university affiliation and try to find their university webpage. If that doesn't work... And you still want the paper, then email (or tweet, that works well too) the _corrosponding author_. They will send you a copy of the paper and I have ALWAYS gotten a reply.. Remember, scientists don't ususally have big fan clubs, if a person emails them and wants to read something they wrote, they will send it. A person once posted me (at his expense) a hard copy of the Canadian Journal of Biology from 1967 September edition.
